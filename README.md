# DashX

DashX is a fast-paced endless runner built entirely in a single HTML file, using embedded CSS for styling and JavaScript for game logic.  

I made this game as a personal coding challenge to see how much I could pack into one file while keeping it fully playable on both desktop and mobile.

The idea started from a basic endless runner, but I wanted to make it unique by adding:
- Switchable visual themes
- A 3-health system
- Potion pickups for health recovery

Over time, I plan to expand DashX with new mechanics, more modes, and visual effects while keeping it optimised for smooth play.
